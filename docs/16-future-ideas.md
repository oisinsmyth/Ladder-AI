# 16 — Future Ideas

Candidate ideas under debate: analysed here for merits and costs until they earn a verdict. This doc fills the gap between the suite's other homes for scope — it holds what is *not yet decided*. Committed work lives in `02-roadmap.md`; excluded work lives in `10-non-goals.md`; in-flight work lives in `AITODO.md` (ephemeral by design). An idea is never silently deleted from here: every entry ends with a recorded verdict or an explicit revisit trigger.

## Lifecycle

Statuses: **Raised → Under debate → Accepted | Rejected | Parked**.

- **Accepted** — promotion into the plan requires an ADR (`docs/adr/`), consistent with `10-non-goals.md`'s "revisit only via ADR" rule, followed by the roadmap/scope edit. The entry stays here with a pointer to the ADR; the ADR is the decision record, this entry is the analysis that led to it.
- **Rejected** — verdict and reason recorded in the entry. If the rejection is a "never", the item also moves to `10-non-goals.md` (with the ADR, per that doc's own rule); a plain "not needed" stays here.
- **Parked** — neither pursued nor dead. Must carry an explicit **revisit trigger** (an event, not a date): what would have to become true for the debate to reopen.

IDs are `FI-xx`, citable the same way as `R-xx` (risks), `C-xxx` (conventions), and `E-xx` (explanation checklist). Numbers are never reused.

## Ideas

### FI-01 — Pattern testing hook (S9 sim harness)
- **Status:** Parked
- **Raised:** 2026-07-16 · **Source:** `AITODO.md` "Carried forward"; the S6 FB/FC pattern redesign dropped the `tests/` folder from `docs/07-pattern-library-spec.md`'s pattern anatomy entirely.
**Merits:** Patterns are the trust anchor of generation (`04-design-philosophy.md` §6); a per-pattern simulated test would let admission criteria include behavioural evidence, not just round-trip and compile evidence, and would give S9 ready-made subjects.
**Costs / risks:** Meaningless until a simulator exists — S9's entry is blocked on the PLCSIM story (R-07, S7-1200 G2 support unconfirmed). Designing a testing hook now would be speculation against an unresolved simulation substrate.
**Dependencies:** S9 entry criteria (S6/S7 in use, R-07 resolved).
**Verdict / revisit trigger:** Revisit when S9 actually opens — decide then whether patterns want a testing hook, not before.

### FI-02 — `Main` (OB1) round-trip support
- **Status:** Parked
- **Raised:** 2026-07-16 · **Source:** `AITODO.md` "Deliberately deferred"; partial OB support already exists (`SecondaryType`, `Informative`/`InformativeComment` fixed; `Output`-section validity still open).
**Merits:** Would close the one block in `SampleProject` that doesn't survive the full cycle, making round-trip coverage literally total.
**Costs / risks:** Each fix so far has revealed another narrow OB-specific Interface-section quirk — an open-ended tail of edge cases. `Main` is TIA's own auto-generated template block, not restricted content, and OB support was never a stated project goal; the payoff is completeness, not capability.
**Dependencies:** None technical — purely a cost/benefit call.
**Verdict / revisit trigger:** Deferred per the project owner's own call. Revisit if real production OB content (not TIA's template) ever needs to pass through the pipeline.

### FI-03 — Modbus multi-instance form
- **Status:** Parked
- **Raised:** 2026-07-16 · **Source:** `AITODO.md` "Deliberately deferred"; considered during reference-corpus growth and deliberately not attempted.
**Merits:** Would extend `Modbus_Master`/`Modbus_Comm_Load` coverage (both already built and unit-tested in single-instance form) to the multi-instance shape, for one FC's worth of optional corpus coverage.
**Costs / risks:** Would have stacked two independently-unproven assumptions at once — exactly the kind of ungrounded construction this project's discipline exists to prevent. No real example exists to ground against; the standalone-instance-DB live-verification gap (a confirmed general Openness limitation, `docs/notes/openness-quirks.md`) compounds the uncertainty.
**Dependencies:** A real, grounded example.
**Verdict / revisit trigger:** Revisit only if a real grounded example of Modbus multi-instance usage ever turns up (a closed engineering call, carried verbatim from `AITODO.md`).

### FI-04 — `WAIT`/`Jump` converter support
- **Status:** Rejected (not needed — project owner's call, 2026-07-14)
- **Raised:** 2026-07-16 · **Source:** carried from S1's sign-off as open questions; closed at the S2 gate. Full grounding preserved in `ir/SPEC.md`'s own entries for each.
**Merits:** Would close the last two instructions from the full `JOB9002` inventory sweep that were investigated but never shipped.
**Costs / risks:** `WAIT` hit "instruction cannot be found" against `SampleProject` during live verification (likely a missing library/technology-object dependency, never identified). `Jump` needs a real IR-format design decision — its `label` port references a new `Access Scope="Label"` node shape, and the jump target is a network-level `<Labels>` element in a *different* `CompileUnit` than the `Jump` Part: genuine cross-network control flow, which nothing in the current IR models.
**Dependencies:** For `Jump`, an IR design decision (ADR-worthy); for `WAIT`, identifying the missing `SampleProject` dependency.
**Verdict / revisit trigger:** Not needed — resolved rather than deferred. The grounding in `ir/SPEC.md` was deliberately kept in case either becomes relevant again; a real production block using either instruction reopens this.

### FI-05 — Close `chained-permissive-enable`'s blind-draft gap
- **Status:** Under debate
- **Raised:** 2026-07-16 · **Source:** `AITODO.md` "Carried forward"; S6 unlock — pattern admission criterion 3 accepted on partial evidence (drafted with prior knowledge of the real answer, not blind), recorded as an open gap rather than silently closed.
**Merits:** A genuinely blind drafted instance is the missing proof that the pattern generalizes; worth having before leaning on this pattern heavily in S6 generation. The earlier blind attempt against JOB9002's station_1 `PlantAutoControl` also surfaced a structurally different case (VSD, edge-detected fault-reset) the pattern doesn't document yet — closing the gap likely improves the pattern itself.
**Costs / risks:** Needs a suitable blind target: real, untouched, and within the recorded data-boundary approval. Low tooling cost; the cost is finding honest test material.
**Dependencies:** None — S6 is open; this was explicitly judged "worth closing before leaning on this pattern heavily, not before S6 can start."
**Verdict / revisit trigger:** Nearest-term entry in this doc. Live tracking stays in `AITODO.md`; this entry records the analysis and will take the verdict when the gap is closed or consciously waived.

### FI-06 — Constructed edge-detection as a fourth pattern kind
- **Status:** Under debate
- **Raised:** 2026-07-16 · **Source:** `docs/07-pattern-library-spec.md` names it explicitly as the example of a shape outside the current three kinds (a cross-block micro-idiom recurring via shared storage, C-402/C-404); FI-05's blind attempt also hit an edge-detected fault-reset case the current patterns can't express.
**Merits:** It is the already-identified next gap in the pattern taxonomy, and `15-generation-pipeline.md` names thin pattern coverage as GenProject1's cause 3 — every kind added shrinks the freeform surface. The FI-05 gap and this one likely close together.
**Costs / risks:** Needs a real grounded example to document from, per pattern-spec discipline; a cross-block idiom needs its own shape defined (the spec says don't force it into an existing kind), which is design work, not just documentation.
**Dependencies:** A grounded example; possibly the S8 harvest step surfacing one from a real build.
**Verdict / revisit trigger:** Open — a natural candidate for the first S8 harvest that touches edge-detected logic.

### FI-07 — `openness-cli cleanup`: a Portal-instance janitor
- **Status:** Raised
- **Raised:** 2026-07-16 · **Source:** CLAUDE.md environment notes — stale Portal-process pileup is the confirmed correlate of "second instance won't connect" (2026-07-14 stability audit), with a manual `tasklist`-and-close mitigation.
**Merits:** `LaunchedInstanceRegistry` already knows which processes the tool launched, so a command that lists/closes only its own idle instances automates the standing mitigation without ever touching a human's window.
**Costs / risks:** Process-killing is the CLI's second irreversible operation; needs the same `--yes` dry-run/confirm pattern as `delete`. "Idle" needs a safe definition — a Portal mid-compile must never be killed.
**Dependencies:** None — the registry and the safety pattern both exist.
**Verdict / revisit trigger:** Open.

### FI-08 — Engineer-side approval path for proposed tags
- **Status:** Under debate
- **Raised:** 2026-07-16 · **Source:** hard rule 3 plus `15-generation-pipeline.md`'s tag-status rule (`exists` | `proposed`); `gen-io-tags` already emits a proposed tag-table IR.
**Merits:** The pipeline produces `proposed` tags but the promotion path — engineer reviews, creates, re-exports — is entirely manual. A defined handoff (the proposed tag-table IR as a reviewable, importable artifact the *engineer* imports after approval) would shorten the most human-bound step of the S6 loop.
**Costs / risks:** Must not blur rule 3's bright line: the engineer's explicit import action has to remain the only path from `proposed` to real. Any convenience that makes the import automatic launders the invention.
**Dependencies:** Real S6 use showing where the friction actually is; `gen-io-tags` (pipeline build-order step 6).
**Verdict / revisit trigger:** Debate properly once a real generation project has been through the tag-proposal loop at least once.

### FI-09 — Convention rules Phase 2: mechanize more of the remaining ~42
- **Status:** Parked
- **Raised:** 2026-07-16 · **Source:** S4 Phase 1 shipped 8 of ~50 rules as mechanical checks; the rough re-estimate of the rest is in `docs/notes/stage-gates.md`. `review-conventions` (pipeline skill 9) wraps `converter review` plus an AI pass over the non-mechanical rules.
**Merits:** Each mechanized rule is a deterministic, zero-hallucination check forever, and directly shrinks the AI-judgment surface `review-conventions` has to carry.
**Costs / risks:** The re-estimate found genuine severity/checkability mismatches — some rules are not mechanical at any reasonable cost; diminishing returns are real.
**Dependencies:** `review-conventions` in real use (pipeline build-order step 3).
**Verdict / revisit trigger:** Revisit when `review-conventions` usage shows which rules actually fire often enough to be worth mechanizing.

### FI-10 — HMI-importable alarm exports from S5
- **Status:** Parked
- **Raised:** 2026-07-16 · **Source:** S5's roadmap entry — extractors "feed existing manual work (HMI alarm tables, O&M manuals, IO checklists)".
**Merits:** One step past CSV/XLSX: emitting a WinCC-importable alarm file turns a documentation byproduct into direct labor savings on existing manual work.
**Costs / risks:** Sits at the edge of the HMI "not now" in `10-non-goals.md` — the line to hold is data export, not HMI engineering. S5 hasn't started; committing now would be premature.
**Dependencies:** S5's basic extractors proven (its exit criterion).
**Verdict / revisit trigger:** Revisit when S5's alarm extractor exists and is verified.

### FI-11 — Presentation-bundling tool for the final gate
- **Status:** Raised
- **Raised:** 2026-07-16 · **Source:** the S6 presentation format (IR diff + intent + compile evidence + reviewer findings) is assembled by hand each time; `15-generation-pipeline.md`'s `generate` skill (13) now owns final presentation.
**Merits:** A small tool that bundles the presentation into one reviewable, archivable artifact gives the engineer of record a uniform audit trail.
**Costs / risks:** Largely absorbed by pipeline skill 13 — the residual idea is only the packaging tool that skill would call. Easy to build too early, before real reviews show what the engineer actually wants in the bundle.
**Dependencies:** The `generate` orchestrator's design (pipeline build-order step 8 — deliberately last).
**Verdict / revisit trigger:** Fold into skill 13's build when it happens; reject as a separate tool if the skill's plain-markdown presentation turns out to be enough.

### FI-12 — Persistent Portal session for the import–compile inner loop
- **Status:** Raised
- **Raised:** 2026-07-16 · **Source:** CLAUDE.md — "TIA project open is slow — be patient"; every `openness-cli` invocation currently pays project-open cost, and `gen-block-coding`'s contract is iterate-until-clean, i.e. many round trips per block.
**Merits:** The dominant latency in the generation inner loop is Portal/project open, not compile. Two designs, same goal: (a) a batch subcommand (import N files, compile, report — one open per iteration set; `RunAllSettled`'s three-phase structure in `tests/golden` is the proven shape), or (b) a long-lived daemon that keeps the scratch project open across iterations. (a) is cheap and proven; (b) is the bigger win and the bigger risk.
**Costs / risks:** (b) collides with everything the 2026-07-13/14 concurrency work made safe: a crashed daemon is exactly the stale-process pileup that causes "won't connect"; single-writer-per-project must hold; crash recovery and idle shutdown need real design. `LaunchedInstanceRegistry` and FI-07 mitigate but don't erase it.
**Dependencies:** Real S6 use measuring where the time actually goes (see FI-16) — (b) should not be built on an assumed bottleneck.
**Verdict / revisit trigger:** Consider (a) as soon as a real generation project shows repeated multi-block iterations; (b) only if measurement shows project-open still dominates after (a).

### FI-13 — Static pre-flight gate before any Portal round trip
- **Status:** Raised
- **Raised:** 2026-07-16 · **Source:** the project's own record — recurring live-verification error classes (tag not defined, type mismatch, missing instance DB, `IsConsistent` refusals) each cost a slow Portal round trip to discover.
**Merits:** A bundled pre-import check — converter round-trip (`to-xml` succeeds), `converter review`, tag-existence grep against the current export (the pipeline's tag-status rule already mandates the grep), instance-DB presence for every CALL — would catch the common failure classes in milliseconds instead of a Portal cycle. Raises the odds the *first* import compiles clean, which compounds with FI-12: fewer round trips, each cheaper.
**Costs / risks:** Must never be presented as the compile gate (hard rule 4) — it is a filter in front of it, not a substitute. Risk of duplicating TIA's compiler badly; scope must stay at the known, recurring error classes.
**Dependencies:** None — every component check already exists; this is composition plus a CLI entry point.
**Verdict / revisit trigger:** Open — cheap enough to pilot during the next real generation build.

### FI-14 — Compile-error playbook: known TIA errors → proven fixes
- **Status:** Raised
- **Raised:** 2026-07-16 · **Source:** `docs/notes/stage-gates.md` and `openness-quirks.md` already contain dozens of hard-won error→fix pairs (PORT needs the system datatype, `Clock_0.5Hz` registration, instance-DB gaps, `IsConsistent` cascades…), but they're narrative — each new session re-derives the diagnosis.
**Merits:** A structured lookup (error signature → confirmed cause → proven fix → source reference) would make `gen-block-coding`'s iterate-until-clean loop converge in fewer iterations and fewer tokens, and stop re-spending investigation effort on already-solved errors.
**Costs / risks:** Curation cost, and a staleness risk: a playbook entry wrong for a new context is worse than no entry — every entry must cite its grounding, and the loop must treat entries as hypotheses to verify, not answers to trust blindly.
**Dependencies:** None — the raw material exists; format and harvest discipline are the work.
**Verdict / revisit trigger:** Open — could start as a section in `openness-quirks.md` and only become tooling if lookup by hand proves too slow.

### FI-15 — Generated block digests for cheap structural context
- **Status:** Raised
- **Raised:** 2026-07-16 · **Source:** the S2 multi-agent experiment (`docs/notes/stage-gates.md`) — explanation quality didn't track context volume; pipeline stages and reviewers often need a block's *shape* (interface, call graph, network titles, tag roots), not its full IR.
**Merits:** A `converter digest <file>` emitting a compact per-block summary would let analysis/design stages and reviewers load structure at a fraction of the tokens, reserving full IR reads for the blocks actually under edit or review. Directly serves the pipeline's isolation model (artifact-only contexts).
**Costs / risks:** Staleness is the killer — the `TimerSample` stale-sidecar bug is this project's own proof that derived files rot. Digests must be generated on demand or verified against the IR's hash at read time, never hand-maintained. Also a subtle quality risk: a reviewer that *should* read every rung (the S2 lesson: exhaustiveness, not summaries, caught the real bugs) must not be handed a digest instead.
**Dependencies:** None technical; the pipeline's per-skill contracts should state digest-vs-full-IR explicitly per stage.
**Verdict / revisit trigger:** Open — decide per pipeline stage, not globally; the reviewers likely stay on full IR by design.

### FI-16 — Per-stage token and latency telemetry with budgets
- **Status:** Raised
- **Raised:** 2026-07-16 · **Source:** the S2 experiment measured token cost against explanation quality once, by hand, and it changed the design (exhaustiveness over context volume). The pipeline now has thirteen skills whose isolation choices are currently judgment calls.
**Merits:** Recording tokens and wall-clock per skill run (a line per run in the `gen/<project>/` artifacts or a simple log) would ground decisions this doc keeps deferring to measurement: whether FI-12(b) is worth its risk, which stages deserve subagent isolation, where FI-15 digests actually pay. Budgets follow once baselines exist.
**Costs / risks:** Low, but only if it stays a log, not a dashboard — the anti-goal is instrumentation polish that outruns the two-project sample size. Latency data is confounded by Portal state (see the pileup findings); record enough context to interpret it.
**Dependencies:** Real pipeline runs to measure — starts paying with the very next generation project.
**Verdict / revisit trigger:** Open — cheapest of this batch; a candidate to adopt informally (manual notes per run) before building anything.

### FI-17 — Explanation sidecars: cached AI block explanations, keyed to IR hash
- **Status:** Raised
- **Raised:** 2026-07-16 · **Source:** conversation — the analysis-cache counterpart to FI-15's mechanical digests. Precedent on both sides: ADR-0004's pipeline artifacts are exactly "one expensive AI pass, written down, consumed downstream" (with `audit-artifact` as the safety net), and S2's explanation capability already produces the content.
**Merits:** One exhaustive AI read per block *version*, cached beside the IR with the hash it was derived from, reused across sessions and stages for orientation — "which block do I need to open?" — instead of re-reading full IR every time. Saves tokens and latency on the most repeated read in the project.
**Costs / risks:** Cached AI judgment that is subtly wrong poisons every consumer that trusts it instead of looking — plausible-looking errors, unlike a mechanical digest's detectable ones. Hard constraints: invalidated by IR hash on any change (the `TimerSample` stale-sidecar bug is the mild mechanical precedent); orientation use only, **never review input** — reviewers read full IR per the S2 exhaustiveness lesson; an explanation is a claim about the block, not ground truth.
**Dependencies:** None technical — the S2 explanation skill exists; needs only a storage convention (sidecar with derived-from hash) and the use-boundary written down.
**Verdict / revisit trigger:** Open — pilot by caching the explanations already produced during normal work before building any tooling for it.
