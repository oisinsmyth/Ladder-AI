# Stage gates

**Active stage: S0 — Foundation** (see `docs/02-roadmap.md` for entry/exit criteria).

Claude Code: do not perform capabilities from stages that haven't passed their gate.

| Stage | Status | Gate review date | Notes |
|-------|--------|------------------|-------|
| S0 — Foundation | **ACTIVE — exit criteria met, gate review pending** | — | Entry criteria met: TIA V20 + Openness installed. Done: repo skeleton; openness-cli `list` with safety filter (built + live-verified, incl. cold-open); Windows "Siemens TIA Openness" group membership confirmed manually via cmd by project owner (2026-07-10); A-01 and A-02 verified (2026-07-10, see Exit-criteria evidence below). Project in use: **JOB9002 - Tom White Waste (scratch copy)**, replacing JOB9003 - K150 (no longer in use) — private engineering project, Amber-tier, explicit per-project approval recorded in `docs/13-data-boundary.md`; incomplete against `06-lad-conventions.md` but sufficient for verification.

### S0
- [x] One command lists all reference-project blocks, F-blocks flagged and never opened — result: `openness-cli list "JOB9003 - K150"` (2026-07-10) attached to the running Portal session, reused the already-open project, and listed 7 blocks (1 OB, 3 DB, 3 FC) across nested groups ("Map IO", "Alarms") with correct type/number/language/path. **Caveat:** this project contains no F-blocks, so live output has nothing flagged — the flagging behavior itself is proven by reflection (all 7 `F_`-prefixed `ProgrammingLanguage` values, `docs/notes/openness-api-surface-v20.md`) and by unit tests (`SafetyClassifierTests`), not by a live F-block. Still open: run against a project that actually contains one, whenever one is available.
- [x] First-connect approval dialog documented in `docs/notes/` — result: no dialog appeared on this run (attach to an already-running, already-approved Portal instance). Documented in `docs/notes/openness-quirks.md`; the exact dialog text/screenshot is still uncaptured and stays open pending a fresh-approval-state test.
- [x] Cold-open (project not already loaded in Portal) — result: `openness-cli list "<path>\JOB9002 - Tom White Waste_V20.ap20"` (2026-07-10), project not previously open, exercised `Projects.Open(FileInfo)` live for the first time (previously reflection-verified only). Succeeded, exit code 0: listed ~150 blocks across two linked PLC stations (`station_1/JOB9001_PLC`, `station_2/JOB9002_PLC`) and every block group (Motors, Map IO, Control, Coms, Alarms, HMI, Simulation). One SCL block present (`LSNTP_Server`); no F-blocks in this project either — safety-flagging still only reflection/unit-test-verified, not live.
- [x] A-01 verified (LAD export/import for S7-1200 G2 incl. comments) — result: verified 2026-07-10 against `JOB9002 - Tom White Waste` (scratch copy, `FC PlantAutoControl`). Export → SimaticML with network titles/comments intact → re-import via `ImportOptions.Override` succeeded cleanly (1 block returned). Full detail: `docs/09-risk-register.md` A-01.
- [x] A-02 verified (programmatic compile gives usable diagnostics) — result: verified 2026-07-10, same spike, immediately after the A-01 re-import. `ICompilable.Compile()` (obtained from the PLC's `DeviceItem`) returned `State=Success, Errors=0, Warnings=0` with structured per-message diagnostics (state/description/path). Deliberately-broken-input case not yet tried. Full detail: `docs/09-risk-register.md` A-02.

**All four S0 exit-criteria items are now evidenced.** Status below reflects that; converting to "done" and starting S1 is a deliberate gate-review step per `docs/03-development-plan.md`, not automatic — held open pending that review.

### S1 (walking skeleton — Contact/Coil-only slice, overall plan items 4–6)

Real findings from the live proof against `JOB9002` blocks (2026-07-11), each a correctness gap
found and fixed, not guessed at — full detail in `src/converter/README.md`:

- **Multiple independent rungs per network are real** — a 16-independent-rung alarm-bit network
  (`PerimeterSafetyAlarms`). `IrNetwork`/`NetworkSidecar` redesigned around a list of coil assignments
  rather than assuming one coil per network.
- **The rail wire is commonly shared across many chains** (one wire, many endpoints) rather than
  one wire per chain — tracked separately (`CoilAssignmentSidecar.RailWireUId`) so it isn't
  mistaken for fan-out that would break series-chain reducibility.
- **Empty networks are real** (`<NetworkSource />`, no content — a trailing placeholder network
  in the same block) — represented as zero coil assignments, not a hard error.
- **Slice access (bit-within-word) addressing is real** — `06-lad-conventions.md` C-501's
  documented alarm convention, confirmed as `SliceAccessModifier="x15"` in the source XML.
  Initially silently collapsed 16 distinct alarm bits into one tag name in the IR (a real bug,
  caught by inspecting `to-ir` output before proceeding, not by a test that happened to check
  for it) — fixed, now preserved as `.%X15` in the IR tag path.
- The root block element needs its own `ID` attribute (`<SW.Blocks.FC ID="0">`, distinct from
  its `CompileUnit` children's IDs), every `MultilingualText`/`MultilingualTextItem` (comments)
  needs its own unique `ID`, and the block's `AttributeList` needs a `<Namespace />` element
  even when empty — all three found one `Import()` attempt at a time (each error was specific
  enough to fix immediately: "missing ID for the 'SW.Blocks.FC' element", then same for
  `MultilingualTextItem`, then "missing 'Namespace' identifier attribute").
- `PlcBlock.Export()` refuses to export an "inconsistent" block (needs recompile in TIA) with a
  clear error.

#### Result, 2026-07-11 — did the walking skeleton pass its own test? Partially.

Layer 1's actual assertion (`docs/08-testing-strategy.md`) is
`SimaticML → IR → SimaticML' → import → compile → re-export → SimaticML''`, with
`SimaticML'' ≡ SimaticML` (via `Normalizer`) as the thing that proves losslessness. That's what
"pass" means here — everything before it is necessary but not sufficient.

**Ran clean — 5 of 6 stages, against a real block (`FC PerimeterSafetyAlarms`, `JOB9002 - Tom White Waste`,
station_2):**
1. `export` — succeeded.
2. `converter to-ir` — succeeded, correct IR (multi-assignment, slice-addressed).
3. `converter to-xml` — succeeded.
4. `import` — succeeded, block returned with no errors.
5. `compile` — `State=Success, Errors=0, Warnings=0`, on two independent runs.

**Did not run — stage 6, the re-export, and therefore the `Normalizer` equivalence check that
was the actual point.** The second `export` call (needed to produce `SimaticML''` to compare
against the original) was refused: `"Inconsistent blocks and PLC data types (UDT) cannot be
exported."` No pass/fail exists for the one assertion that proves losslessness — the test
didn't complete, not "completed and failed."

**Why, and why it's not this session's bug:** reproduced the identical refusal on `ControlMain`,
a block untouched by any work this session, and it matches an identical error hit hours earlier
(before any import activity at all) exporting `PlantAutoControl` in the same station. So the
`station_2` PLC software's inconsistency predates this session's import, isn't caused by it, and
a clean project-wide compile (checked twice) doesn't clear it either.

**Precisely characterized, 2026-07-11, by the new `openness-cli sanity-check <project>`**
(built specifically to answer this — reads every block's `IsConsistent` flag directly, no export
attempt needed, plus compiles every PLC device found): 180 blocks total, **15 inconsistent**,
all under `station_2/JOB9002_PLC`, clustered in `Map IO/Simulation` (simulation-mode blocks) and
`Control`/`Alarms` (`ControlMain`, `PlantAutoControl`, `AlarmsMain`, `PerimeterSafetyAlarms`) — while **both**
device compiles report `Success, Errors=0, Warnings=0` at the same time. Confirms conclusively
this is a real TIA/Openness block-consistency state issue in the scratch project, not a timing
artifact or something a second compile fixes. Full detail and the clustering hypothesis:
`docs/notes/openness-quirks.md`. Outside what `openness-cli`/the converter can fix from here —
needs the project owner to check directly in TIA Portal.

**Bottom line:** the converter/CLI produce output TIA's `Import()` accepts and that compiles
cleanly — real evidence the design works. The specific claim "this round-trips losslessly"
stays unproven pending either the project's consistency state getting resolved, or a re-run
against a block/project that isn't affected by it.

#### Cold-open re-test + second full attempt, 2026-07-11

Project owner saved and closed the scratch project and TIA Portal entirely, then asked for a
fresh re-run. `sanity-check` against a fresh Portal launch reproduced byte-identical results (180
blocks, same 15 inconsistent, both device compiles `Success`) — rules out session-state/caching
as the explanation. Full detail: `docs/notes/openness-quirks.md`.

Chose a different, previously-unaffected block (`NodeStatusAlarms`, `station_2/JOB9002_PLC/Alarms`) to
attempt a clean full round-trip. Hit a new, real converter bug on `converter to-xml`: the same
tag path can be referenced by two distinct `<Access>` XML elements (different UIds) in one
network, which crashed `FlgNetBuilder`'s `TagPath`-keyed rebuild lookup. Fixed by threading the
exact source Access UId positionally through `CoilAssignmentSidecar` instead of re-deriving it by
tag path at rebuild time — no XML was hand-patched (hard rule 7); full detail:
`src/converter/README.md`. All 17 converter tests still pass.

With the fix, `export → to-ir → to-xml → import → compile` ran clean end-to-end on `NodeStatusAlarms`
(import returned the block with no errors; compile reported `Success, Errors=0, Warnings=0`).
Stage 6 (re-export for the `Normalizer` equivalence check) still didn't run: `sanity-check`
immediately after showed `NodeStatusAlarms` newly flagged inconsistent (16 total now, the original 15
plus this one), and a second compile didn't clear it.

**Root cause found, same session:** project owner opened the newly-inconsistent `NodeStatusAlarms` in
the TIA UI to inspect it directly and spotted the actual defect — `"CommsProcessData".Node_Error` is
a `BOOL` array, and three separate array elements (`[1]`, `[2]`, `[3]`) feed three separate alarm
bits (`ModbusAlarm.%X0/1/2`). The converter's `AccessNode` had no concept of array-subscript
addressing, so all three `Node_Error[n]` references collapsed to the identical, ambiguous
`CommsProcessData.Node_Error` in the IR — this is also what caused the earlier `FlgNetBuilder`
crash (three genuinely different Access elements sharing one indistinguishable tag path). Ground
truth for the fix was pulled from an untouched sibling block (`station_1/JOB9001_PLC/Alrams/
NodeStatusAlarms`, never imported into) rather than guessed: `<Component Name="Node_Error"
AccessModifier="Array"><Access Scope="LiteralConstant"><Constant><ConstantType>DInt</ConstantType>
<ConstantValue>n</ConstantValue></Constant></Access></Component>`. Fixed by adding
`AccessNode.ArrayIndex`, parsed/written explicitly, IR notation `Node_Error[n]`. Verified against
that same untouched block: `to-ir` now shows 15 distinct `Node_Error[0..14]` tag paths instead of
one collapsed path, and `to-ir → to-xml` regenerates the exact `AccessModifier="Array"` + nested
`Constant` structure with the correct per-element index. Full detail: `src/converter/README.md`.

**Follow-up test, same session — the array-index fix was real, but it wasn't the reason blocks go
inconsistent.** `station_2/NodeStatusAlarms`'s copy in the scratch project was already contaminated
by the pre-fix import (and the pristine original had been deleted in scratchpad cleanup), so
re-testing it wouldn't prove anything. Instead ran the full chain against the untouched
`station_1/JOB9001_PLC/Alrams/NodeStatusAlarms`: `export → to-ir → to-xml` (regenerated XML inspected
directly and confirmed byte-structurally correct — same `AccessModifier="Array"` shape, correct
per-element index, as the original) → `import` (succeeded) → `compile` (`Success, Errors=0,
Warnings=0`). `sanity-check` immediately after still showed `NodeStatusAlarms` newly inconsistent
(plus its caller `AlarmMain`, same clustering pattern as station_2) — on content now verified
correct, not just "compiled so probably fine." A second compile didn't clear it either; `export`
kept refusing.

**Conclusion:** `IsConsistent = false` after import is not explained by content defects — it
reproduces on genuinely byte-correct, round-tripped content just as it did on the earlier
array-index-lossy content. It looks like an inherent side effect of `Import()` in this
project/TIA version (importing a block flags it and its caller(s) inconsistent; device-level
`Compile()` never clears it), separate from converter correctness. Full detail:
`docs/notes/openness-quirks.md`. Whether the original 15 pre-existing inconsistent blocks were
introduced the same way (an earlier round of Import() before this session) is now a plausible
explanation, still unconfirmed — needs the project owner to check in the TIA UI.

**Resolved, same session: block-level compile clears it; device-level `compile` doesn't.** Project
owner opened `station_1/NodeStatusAlarms` in the TIA UI, ran block-level "Compile (only changes)", then
compiled the whole PLC. `sanity-check` immediately after: `NodeStatusAlarms` and `AlarmMain`
(station_1) both cleared — back to the original 16 (station_2's pre-existing set, plus the still-
contaminated `station_2/NodeStatusAlarms`). Root cause: `ICompilable.Compile()` on a `DeviceItem` —
the only compile granularity Openness's object model exposes, and what `openness-cli
compile`/`sanity-check` use — is **not equivalent** to TIA's own block-level compile for clearing
`IsConsistent` after `Import()`. A real Openness/TIA behavior, not a converter or `openness-cli`
bug. Full detail: `docs/notes/openness-quirks.md`.

**Practical implication (hard rule 4):** a device-level `compile` after `import` isn't sufficient
proof a generated/modified block is clean — the compile gate needs a block-level compile too,
which today only exists via the TIA UI. Worth adding block-level compile to `openness-cli` if this
keeps mattering past S1.

**Stage 6 reached, same session, immediately after the block-level compile.** With
`station_1/NodeStatusAlarms` cleared, `export` was retried — succeeded (previously refused every
time). Inspected the re-exported XML directly: 15/15 `AccessModifier="Array"` array-index
Components and 15/15 `SliceAccessModifier` slice-access Components present, matching the original
exactly. This is the walking skeleton's actual target assertion
(`SimaticML → IR → SimaticML' → import → compile → re-export → SimaticML''`, `SimaticML'' ≡
SimaticML`), reached end-to-end for the first time this project, on real production LAD data
(multi-assignment, array-indexed, slice-addressed). A formal `Normalizer`-based automated diff
(vs. this manual field-count check) is still open — `tests/golden/`'s `Normalizer` exists but
hasn't been run against this pair.

**Gap closed, same session: `openness-cli compile --block <name>` added, no TIA UI step needed.**
Reflecting on the installed V20 DLL showed `PlcBlock` implements `IEngineeringServiceProvider`
just like `DeviceItem`/`PlcSoftware` — untested territory, so verified live with a throwaway spike
before building anything: `plcBlock.GetService<ICompilable>()` returns non-null, and calling
`.Compile()` on `station_2/NodeStatusAlarms` (still inconsistent) flipped `IsConsistent` to `true`
immediately, no UI interaction. Built `IOpennessGateway.CompileBlock` on top of this and wired it
to a new `--block` flag on `compile`; same safety refusal and `--device` disambiguation as
`export`. All 68 openness-cli tests pass.

Live-verified against the full remaining inconsistent list: `openness-cli compile --block
PerimeterSafetyAlarms` cleared it — one of the *original* 15 pre-existing blocks, predating this session
entirely, proving the original mystery and this session's self-inflicted cases share the exact
same mechanism. Ran `--block` compile across every remaining inconsistent block (the
`Simulation`/`DOLSim`/`VSDSim` cluster, `ControlMain`, `PlantAutoControl`, `AlarmsMain`) — one real
finding along the way: `ControlMain` failed with a genuine `State=Error` the first time (it calls
`PlantAutoControl`, compiled after it in this run), then succeeded cleanly once retried after
`PlantAutoControl` was clean — compile order matters for callers. Final `sanity-check`:
**`OVERALL: HEALTHY`, 0 of 180 blocks inconsistent.** Full detail: `docs/notes/openness-quirks.md`,
`src/openness-cli/README.md`.

**Updated bottom line:** the converter/CLI's output is accepted by `Import()`, is byte-structurally
correct against real array-indexed data, compiles clean at both device and block level, and
round-trips through a real `export` with the array-index and slice-access structures intact. S1's
core technical claim — lossless SimaticML↔IR round-trip for this converter slice — now has live,
end-to-end evidence. The compile-gate gap (hard rule 4) that required a human TIA UI step is
closed: `openness-cli compile --block <name>` does it programmatically, and using it end to end
brought the entire scratch project (both stations, 180 blocks) to fully healthy for the first time
this session.
